/*
    Garbage Collection
    Mainly used for cleaning up OpenCascade WASM references
    We use the readily availble Javascript FinalizationRegistry
    See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry
    Approach inspired by Steve Genoud in Replicad: https://github.com/sgenoud/replicad/pull/4

    Usage:
        For every Class that wraps OpenCascade primitives use global method:
        
        targetOcForGarbageCollection(this, ocObj)

        When main class (like Shape, Edge) is garbage collected we call
        ocObj.delete() to free memory 

    NOTES: 
        - Browser/Node garbage collection is not every second. In browser you can trigger it to test if callbacks are working
          For example in Chrome: More Tools -> Development Tools -> Memory > Collect Garbage

        - For temporary OpenCascade instances, directly delete them after use

        - We need to be very carefyl avoiding shared OC instances, because one Class instance might delete it before another is done using it
