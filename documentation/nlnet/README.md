# Archiyou NLNET documentation

<img src="https://nlnet.nl/logo/banner.svg" width="20%" align="right">Thanks to [NLNET NG0 Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/project/Archiyou/) we can further develop the open source and open design community functionality of Archiyou. 

This is a basic roadmap:

- [x] Open design user research, strategy and UX/UI
- [x] DevX: Archiyou as module, examples, templates
- [x] New high performance (mesh) geometry kernel: [CSGRS](https://github.com/timschmidt/csgrs) and [Meshup](https://github.com/ArchiyouApp/meshup)
- [ ] Fully open source stack (including publishing)
- [ ] New lightweight viewer/configurator: portability, extendability
- [ ] New editor: more value for more users
- [ ] New open design platform

Please reach out for more information, ideas or collaboration!
